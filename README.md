Inoculation Against the Other Pandemic: A Consumer Side Approach to India's Fake News Problem
Apr 2020 â€“ Apr 2021

Co-conducted research (with Poorvi Gupta and Nidhi Priya) on the impact of an online cognitive inoculation (created by Cambridge University and DROG) on self-reported perception of fake news on social media, on an Indian sample (N=1002); adopting both parametric (MANOVA, MANCOVA and ANOVA) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon's Matched Pair Test) testing methods in a before-after study design. Results obtained showed significant (albeit with small effect sizes) reduction in self-reported reliability scores of various fake news items; and concluded that the intervention caused greater discernment among the participants rather than greater skepticism. Sub-sample analysis on the basis of demographic features also studied the impact of political ideology, education, age, and intuitive ability on the extent of the intervention's impact.

This project was conducted with support from the Goutham Krishna Research Fellowship awarded by St. Stephen's College, University of Delhi, under the mentorship of Prof. Poonam Kalra.
